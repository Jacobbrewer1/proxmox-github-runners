# APIs

This is where the API specifications are documented. This is also where the codegen lives.

## Codegen

You just need to run the following command in the root of the project to generate the API client:

```bash
make codegen
```

Otherwise, you can cd to the specific API directory and run the following command:

```bash
go generate
```
