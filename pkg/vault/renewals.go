// RenewLease Once you've set the token for your Vault client, you will need to
// periodically renew it. Likewise, the database credentials lease will expire
// at some point and also needs to be renewed periodically.
//
// A function like this one should be run as a goroutine to avoid blocking.
// Production applications may also need to be more tolerant of failures and
// retry on errors rather than exiting.
//
// Additionally, enterprise Vault users should be aware that due to eventual
// consistency, the API may return unexpected errors when running Vault with
// performance standbys or performance replication, despite the client having
// a freshly renewed token. See the link below for several ways to mitigate
// this which are outside the scope of this code sample.
